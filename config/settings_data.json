By using the Stuhrling Original website and repair or warranty service, you agree to the terms and conditions set forth herein. These terms are terms of a legal agreement between you and the Stuhrling Original, and are collectively referred to herein as the \"Agreement\".</p><p>           1. Length of repair time</p><p>We make no guarantees regarding the length of repair time. Due to the nature of the repair, the varying timeliness of parts suppliers and availability of parts, we will provide a general estimate.</p><p>Please note - if you fail to respond to Stuhrling Original’s correspondence, either phone or email within 60 days, we may dispose of the watch. </p><p>          2. Guarantee of Repair</p><p>Stuhrling Original does not guarantee that we can repair your watch. We must first inspect your watch to determine: the needed repairs to ensure the watch functions correctly, the availability of the parts to complete the repair, and the cost to complete the repair. If, in the judgment of the Stuhrling original, your watch cannot be repaired, due to lack of parts, you agree to pay the return shipping for the watch. In the event that you do not want to proceed with the repairs, you are responsible for the return shipping costs.</p><p>          3. Manufacturer Repairs</p><p>In the event that Stuhrling Original is not able to provide an estimate due to unavailable parts, we will ask for authorization to send your watch to the manufacturer for further valuation. If given the approval, we will ship your watch at our expense to this location. While at the manufacturer, Stuhrling Original is not liable for loss, damage, or any other problems associated with the repair.</p><p>          4. Decision to begin repair is final</p><p>Watch repair begins when your approval is granted and payment is received in full. Once the watch repair begins we are unable to stop the repair.</p><p>          5. Return Shipment</p><p>Stuhrling Original cannot guarantee the time of delivery. If you are not available to receive the delivery after multiple attempts, the package may be returned to us, at which point you are responsible for an additional payment to cover re-shipment. Stuhrling Original will not be responsible for items delivered to incorrect addresses supplied by the sender; delays in delivery due to the fault of the delivery service contracted.</p><p>          6. Payment / Refund Policy</p><p>Upon acceptance of our repair estimate, you will be required to pay the corresponding amount. Upon completing the warranty or repair form and providing payment for the repair, you have made a legally binding agreement to proceed with the repair. If Stuhrling Original deems the watch unrepairable after payment, a full refund minus return shipping will be issued.</p><p>Warranty.<br/><br/>All internal repair work is guaranteed for one year. Any damage to the watch resulting from normal or extreme use is not covered under the warranty. Items not covered by the warranty include the crystal, band, stem and crown, or any damage from normal, extreme, or inappropriate use.</p>"

But Chaim wanted to “start at the top”—especially once the “elites” told him there was only one place on the planet capable of producing tourbillons.</p><p>Rather than lowering his sights, Chaim set out to prove them wrong—by assembling a first-rate team of watchmaking legends and founding a new place that, despite being a hemisphere away, was still the first choice of everyone from Apple to Bose for the reliable precision manufacturing needed to produce their brand-defining products.</p><p>The result? A groundbreaking tourbillon collection, at an equally groundbreaking price.</p>",
              "description2": "<p>While those tourbillons swiftly sold out, Chaim’s commitment to authenticity with an attitude bordering on audacity didn’t. That’s why a full range of complications—including open-heart/skeletons, chronographs, dive watches, dress watches and dual-time/travel watches—quickly followed Stührling’s tourbillon debut.</p><p>Could Chaim have “sold out” and used beautiful people and places to sell his watches, instead of beautifully crafted dials, movements, and cases? Oh yeah—and he would’ve sold way more watches (and in the process, his soul and vision).</p><p>Luckily he didn’t, and to this day Stührling continues to be the standard for seriously crafted timepieces at seriously grounded prices.</p>"

Certain chemicals, such as those found in chlorinated water and some perfumes or hairsprays, can damage the case seams and gaskets, so be careful when exposing your watch to those elements.

This is because the hot temperature of the water can cause the metal to expand at a different rate than the rubber gaskets, allowing water to enter the case. Accidental leakage caused by a rapid change in temperature is one of the major causes of water damage to water-resistant watches, so we recommend that you do not expose your watch to extreme heat or drastic changes in temperature. This is the same reason that we do not suggest wearing your Stührling in saunas or hot tubs as well."

The majority of our watches can be adjusted by doing the following: To set the date of the month (26,27,28…) pull the crown out to position one and turn it forward (clockwise). To set the day of the week (Sunday, Monday…), turn the crown backwards (counter-clockwise) in position one. Please do not set the date or day when the time on the watch is between 9:00 PM and 3:00 AM, as the watch movement has begun to change the date/day automatically and adjusting it manually may break the movement.

              "content": "For many years, the one constant across nearly all consumer-related products sold at the retail level was that they were offered in a physical store. These brick-and-mortar retailers have their own business expenses, and it was considered normal for a retailer to get double or triple their wholesale cost for any product sold. In turn, when manufacturers would create their MSRPs (regardless of their category), they would always allow for these markups at the retail level and would then reverse engineer their margins from there.\n\nPlease know that while the fair market value of the Stührling timepieces are noticeably less than the suggested MSRP listed for each model, the MSRPs for Stührling timepieces are based on the accepted principles of manufacturing costs within the watch industry, in order to make a fair comparison to other watches in the marketplace.\n\nThe mission and vision of Stührling has always been to deliver luxury-engineered timepieces to a broader audience. In striving to fulfill this vision, Stührling continues to focus on ecommerce and alternate retailers. By forgoing a brick-and-mortar presence, we are able to keep the price of our watches more accessible and extend those savings directly to the consumer."
